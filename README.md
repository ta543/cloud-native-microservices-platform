# Cloud-Native Microservices Platform 🚀

## Overview 📋

The Cloud-Native Microservices Platform is an exemplary project demonstrating a modern approach to building and deploying scalable, resilient applications using Kubernetes, Docker, and various CI/CD and monitoring tools. This platform is designed to showcase best practices in cloud-native development, including microservices architecture, containerization, automated deployments, and observability.

## Features 🌟

- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design for easy maintenance, scalability, and resilience.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Automated CI/CD**: Using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery workflows.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, and the EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for monitoring and logging.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, Docker Desktop, or a cloud provider-managed Kubernetes service)
- Helm (optional, for easier deployment management)
- Git

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cloud-native-microservices-platform
```

## Build and Push Docker Images 🐳

> **Optional**: This step is optional if you're using pre-built images.

## Getting Started

To build Docker images for each microservice, navigate to the microservice directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t <your-registry>/<service-name>:<tag> .
docker push <your-registry>/<service-name>:<tag>
```

# Deploy to Kubernetes 🚀

For each microservice and infrastructure component (Prometheus, Grafana, EFK), apply the Kubernetes manifests or use Helm charts:

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/kubernetes/dev/<service-deployment-file>
```

# Or using Helm
```bash
helm install <release-name> infra/helm/<service-chart>
```

# Accessing the Services 🚀

## Microservices
Access the microservices through their Ingress URLs or service NodePorts.

## Grafana
Access Grafana dashboards for monitoring at `http://<grafana-service-ip>:3000`.

## Kibana
Access Kibana for logs at `http://<kibana-service-ip>:5601`.
