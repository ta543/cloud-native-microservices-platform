# üå©Ô∏è Architecture Overview of Cloud-Native Microservices Platform

## üìú Introduction
This document outlines the architecture of the Cloud-Native Microservices Platform, designed to provide scalable, resilient, and flexible services deployed on Kubernetes. It covers the microservices design, infrastructure, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes, and monitoring and logging systems.

## üèóÔ∏è Microservices Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Loose Coupling:** Services are designed to be independent, communicating via well-defined APIs.
- **High Cohesion:** Each microservice is responsible for a discrete piece of functionality.
- **Database Per Service:** Each service owns its database to ensure loose coupling.
- **Statelessness:** Services are stateless, storing state in external services or databases.

### Services
- **User Service:** Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles.
- **Todo Service:** Handles the creation, updating, and viewing of todo items.
- **Post Service:** Allows users to create, edit, and view posts.

### Communication
Services communicate synchronously via RESTful APIs for direct queries and asynchronously using message queues for events and notifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure

### Kubernetes
- **Containers:** Each microservice is containerized, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Pods:** Microservices run in pods, the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.
- **Services:** Kubernetes services enable network access to sets of pods, facilitating inter-service communication.
- **Ingress:** Manages external access to the services, routing traffic to the appropriate service.

### Cloud Providers
The platform is designed to be cloud-agnostic, capable of running on major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, leveraging managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS).

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions** for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Helm** for packaging and deploying applications to Kubernetes.

### Process
- **Code Commit:** Developers commit code to the repository, triggering the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Build:** The pipeline builds a Docker image for the updated service.
- **Test:** Runs automated tests to verify the functionality and integrity of the application.
- **Deploy:** If tests pass, the pipeline deploys the application to the appropriate Kubernetes environment using Helm.

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- **Prometheus** collects metrics from each microservice, such as request count, response times, and error rates.
- **Grafana** visualizes these metrics through dashboards, enabling real-time monitoring of the system's health.

### Logging with the EFK Stack
- **Elasticsearch** stores logs collected from the microservices.
- **Fluentd** aggregates logs from various sources and forwards them to Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana** provides a web interface for searching and visualizing logs.

## üéâ Conclusion
The Cloud-Native Microservices Platform is designed to offer flexibility, scalability, and resilience. By leveraging Kubernetes, a microservices architecture, and robust CI/CD processes, the platform ensures rapid development, testing, and deployment cycles. Monitoring and logging tools provide insights into the system's health and facilitate troubleshooting and optimization.
