# ðŸš€ Setup Instructions for Cloud-Native Microservices Platform ðŸš€

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up the Cloud-Native Microservices Platform. It covers everything from prerequisites, local development setup, cloud environment setup, to monitoring and logging.

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup, ensure you have the following tools and accounts ready:

- **Docker**: For building and running containerized applications.
- **Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)**: For interacting with your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Helm**: For managing Kubernetes packages.
- **A Cloud Provider Account**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or your preferred provider.
- **Git**: For version control.

## ðŸ›  Local Development Environment Setup

### Step 1: Install Docker and Kubernetes

- **Docker**: Download and install Docker.
- **Kubernetes**: Use Docker Desktop or Minikube for a local Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 2: Clone the Project Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cloud-native-microservices-platform
```

### Step 3: Build and Run Microservices Locally
- Navigate to each microservice directory and build Docker images:

```bash
docker build -t <service-name>:<version> .
```
Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes manifests to run your microservices:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Or:

```bash
kubectl apply -f infra/kubernetes/dev
```

## Cloud Environment Setup

### Step 1: Set Up Kubernetes Cluster
Create a Kubernetes cluster using your cloud provider's service (e.g., EKS, GKE, AKS). Follow the provider's documentation for specifics.

### Step 2: Configure kubectl
Configure kubectl to connect to your newly created Kubernetes cluster. This often involves downloading a config file and setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable.

### Step 3: Deploy Microservices to the Cloud
Deploy your services using kubectl or Helm. For Helm:


```bash
helm install <release-name> infra/helm/<service-chart>
```

Repeat for each microservice.

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Logging Setup
Prometheus and Grafana for Monitoring
Deploy Prometheus:


```bash
kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus
```

### Deploy Grafana:


```bash
kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana
```

Access Grafana through the web browser to configure dashboards.

Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) for Logging
Deploy Elasticsearch:


```bash
kubectl apply -f monitoring/efk/elasticsearch-deployment.yaml
```

Ensure Fluentd is configured to collect logs and forward them to Elasticsearch.

Deploy Kibana:

```bash
kubectl apply -f monitoring/efk/kibana-deployment.yaml
```

Access Kibana to view and analyze logs collected from your microservices.
